# Luciano Palacio

Hello, I am a freelance Software Developer. I contributed to multiple projects for both personal and corporate clients.

I studied the career of "Systems Analyst" at the University of Rio Cuarto([**UNRC**](https://www.unrc.edu.ar/)).

I have experiences in multiples tecnologies like:

- Next.js
- Laravel
- Node Js
- Spring Boot
- ElasticSearch
- React Native
- Relational and non-relational databases.

I have experience in multiple projects such as:

- An e-commerce software to sell and buy products.
- An agricultural machinery management software.
- A self-testing software.

Finally, I consider myself a very responsible person, capable of working independently or in a team, and in the latter case, I quickly adapt to the team's work style.

Now, I am looking for new clients and projects to continue developing as a programmer.
